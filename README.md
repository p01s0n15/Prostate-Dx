# Prostate Cancer Detection and Risk Classification using MRI Scans

This project focuses on detecting prostate cancer and classifying its risk levels using **MRI scans** as the sole input. By experimenting with over 100 machine learning models, the project aims to achieve high accuracy in both cancer detection and risk stratification.

## Key Features

- **Prostate Cancer Detection**: Predicts the presence or absence of prostate cancer from MRI images.
- **Risk Classification**: Classifies the risk level of prostate cancer into categories such as low, medium, and high.
- **Extensive Model Development**: Over 100 models were experimented with to optimize performance using various machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The models were trained using MRI scan data sourced from the **Prostate MRI US Biopsy dataset**, containing over **1 lakh MRI images**. The dataset includes labeled images with different prostate cancer stages and corresponding risk classifications.

## Models Developed

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Ensemble Methods**
- **Classical Models**: 
    - Random Forests
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Naive Bayes Classifiers
    - Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
    - K-means Clustering

These models were trained and optimized through extensive experimentation, including **hyperparameter tuning** and **data augmentation** techniques.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 
    - 85.03% for cancer detection
    - 60.71% for cancer risk classification
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Minimum of **0.4265** for cancer risk detection using regressors

The models have demonstrated strong performance in both detection accuracy and risk classification.
